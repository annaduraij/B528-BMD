Assignment 5:

Write a script which can calculate the degree and clustering coefficient for every node (protein)
in the human protein interaction network (attached). Now calculate the average clustering coefficient
of the network. Finally, test whether the network has a scale-free structure by plotting the degree distribution?

Now write another script which can calculate the shortest path lengths between every pair of nodes (proteins)
in the attached files (two files are attached). Compare the path length distributions between the two protein
sets using a wilcox test.
